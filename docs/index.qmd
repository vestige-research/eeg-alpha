## Welcome

**eeg-alpha** is a tutorial-driven project for learning EEG analysis and neurofeedback using consumer hardware.

### What You'll Learn

- How to acquire EEG data with BrainFlow and OpenBCI
- Signal processing techniques for alpha wave detection
- Real-time neurofeedback implementation
- Best practices for EEG research with open-source tools

### Getting Started

This project uses the **OpenBCI Cyton** board (8 channels) or **Cyton + Daisy** (16 channels). Don't have hardware? No problem! All tutorials work with synthetic (simulated) data.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vestige/eeg-alpha.git
cd eeg-alpha

# Set up environment
./setup.sh

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Hardware

- **Synthetic Board**: No hardware needed (great for learning!)
- **OpenBCI Cyton**: 8-channel EEG system
- **OpenBCI Cyton + Daisy**: 16-channel EEG system
